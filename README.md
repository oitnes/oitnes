# **About me**

### Hi, my name is Siarhei.

I graduated **Belarus State University**, where I majored in Radiophysics with a focus on communication systems for small spacecraft.  

My primary research interest efforts were geared towards utilizing neural networks. This endeavor involved creating models that could efficiently analyze and interpret HTTP traffic on the fly.

Post-graduation, I pursued a career in the IT sector, working with several companies and startups as a **Research & Development Engineer**. My professional journey has been marked by extensive experience in developing and applying innovative technologies such as **Computer Vision Neural Network models** and **Distributed systems**, along with development of regular information systems and libs.
